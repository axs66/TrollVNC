/**
 ScreenCapturer
 ----------------
 A singleton that captures the device screen into an IOSurface and produces
 CMSampleBufferRef frames on a CADisplayLink-driven cadence. Intended for use
 by encoders/streamers that require CVPixelBuffer-backed sample buffers.

 Threading & lifetime:
 - startCapture/endCapture must be called on the main thread (internally uses CADisplayLink on main run loop).
 - The provided frame handler is invoked on the main thread.
 - ARC only.

 Performance & format:
 - Uses IOSurface + CoreAnimation render server to copy screen contents.
 - Zero-copy wrapping via CVPixelBufferCreateWithIOSurface.
 - Pixel format is ARGB as defined by sharedRenderProperties.

 Debug stats (DEBUG builds only):
 - Average FPS is periodically logged over a configurable window.
 - Instantaneous FPS is computed from CADisplayLink.duration and can be smoothed with EMA.
